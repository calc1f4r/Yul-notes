## Introduction to Yul
Yul is an intermediate language designed for the Ethereum blockchain. It is used to write low-level code that can be compiled to EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) bytecode.

## Basic Syntax
- Variables
- Constants
- Operations

## Control Structures
- If statements
- Switch statements
- For loops
- While loops

## Functions
- Defining functions
- Calling functions
- Function returns

## Memory and Storage
- Memory management
- Storage management

## Examples
- Example 1: Simple addition
- Example 2: Conditional logic
- Example 3: Looping constructs
